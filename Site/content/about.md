## About DutyPusher

DutyPusher is an open-source Dalamud plugin developed by MorCherlf for *Final Fantasy XIV* (FFXIV). It aims to help players relax away from their computers while waiting in queue for dungeons. By utilizing multiple extensible push channels, players can receive immediate notifications when their queue pops, ensuring they never miss a dungeon.

**Key Features**

- **Multiple Push Channels Supported**: Currently supports Bark, PushDeer, and Telegram Bot official APIs, with plans to expand to more push channels in the future.
- **Instant Notifications**: When your dungeon queue pops, DutyPusher will immediately send a notification to your device.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple setup allows you to start using it right away.
- **Customizable Options**: Supports custom notification sounds and instant notifications (Bark).
- **Fully Open Source**: DutyPusher is fully open source. You can create your own fork or submit a Pull Request to us.
- **As Safe as Possible**: DutyPusher does not interact with the game server or directly modify/operate the game in any way. Except for sending notifications, which requires network requests to the respective push channel servers, it does not collect, record, or store any information.
